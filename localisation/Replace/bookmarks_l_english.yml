 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Occident in Flames"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "'We'll be remembered as the generation that destroyed all this.' - Iouliana Erdemir, to Evgenia Exteberria"
 HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 MRT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Rishma Sharqi has transformed the absolutist monarchy she inherited into a new Communist state-- not a meek communal democracy in the Byzantine vein, but a hardline Mullerist dictatorship with the strength to stamp out the bourgeoisie of Western India.\n\n Politicans in Byzantion and Edinburgh shake their head, but Marathas has the power to make itself indispensible to the RRP-- if it desires. On the other hand, the liberal government of Hindustan falters and Indian unification tantalizes."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 1920s were a whirlwind of change for what was once the Kingdom of France. Valeria Imperatrix was swept to power, the slogan 'Begin again!' on her lips; she savaged Germany in a lightning war and brought victory to France; she died and began again and lived. Valeria Postuma broods in Paris, knowing that revenge against the NGF is just the beginning. \n\nThe road to the conquest of Europe leads straight through Byzantium-- barbarians squatting on Rome's rightful inheritance. They will fall, and the Near West will begin again."
 AYI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The victors of the First Great War became the vanquished of the second when Britain and Byzantium intervened to stop Ayiti from dominating Avalon once and for all. \n\nThe new Ayiti Commune established by the victorious RRP has brought prosperity but not unity. Its tribune works towards a future as a full member of the Red Rose Pact-- but is it the future the people want?"
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Silver rules the world, and all silver flows to China. With the Empress a virtual prisoner in the Forbidden City, Zhang Zhulin and his consortium of pangalist corporations have all the resources of the Ming Empire at their disposal. \n\nCommunists and fascists fight over the ruins of the past. Sickly liberal republics cling to their scraps. The future belongs to the bold, and few are as bold as the pangalist ideologues of China."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan, the world's first modern republic and its foremost bastion of liberalism, was dealt a humiliating setback when Somalia and the Ming Empire ejected them from much of their sphere of influence following a disastrous war in the Near West. \n\nThe Allies, under Japan's leadership, have circled their wagons, preparing for an existential war against the Pangalist WPO. Will the tricolors fly in the second half of the 20th century? Or will the Republic be devoured by its children?"
 SOM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Somalia has shaken off the tyranny of its Lord Protector and restored the patrician Republic. A fruitful alliance with China has already led to one smashing victory against the Japanese and their allies. \n\nThe patricians of the Republic expect a second one to follow, should war break out again. But, to the north, storm clouds gather, and threaten to take the whole Near West down with them."
 BYZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The leader of the Red Rose Pact, the home of the Revolution, the inheritors of the Roman Empire, no matter how much they deny it. \n\nAfter victory in the Second Great War, the bleak prospect of a third looms, not in far-off Avalon, but as a conflagration which threatens to devour the Near West. Will Iouliana Erdemir's worker's paradise endure, or will the dream die beneath Valerian boots? Raise the red flags, unite the workers, defend the City of the World's Desire."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "War between the continent-spanning Great Powers seems all but inevitable. Will it be an opportunity for the other nations of the world to rise in their place? Or are they nothing but grist for the mill of Empire?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Third Rome, Defender of the Orthodox Faith, is a tottering wreck of a state. The Tsaritsa sees her empire beset by enemies within and without. The people are a mass of impoverished serfs. The army, though large, is little more than a shambling mob. But within this uneasy kingdom, there are the seeds of a mighty and powerful state, and Third Rome may yet tip the scales in any conflict it finds itself in."
 IRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After decades of civil war, Ireland is again at peace and ready to rebuild. The new socialist government of Aoife O'Connor sets upon the slow and difficult process of peace and reconciliation. It watches the chaos of Europe in an unease, thankful again for the miles of ocean that separate them from the continent. Will their new socialist government remain, or will it fall into a new era of chaos and strife?"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Great Britain has elected another socialist government, continuing its peaceful move towards the extreme left. Even so, the government finds itself in an uneasy place. Will the French, with their dreams of empire, covet the British lands? What of the remaining liberals and the monarchy? The holdings in the Congo are also a source of tension between it and other socialist powers. Will it continue its transition into socialism? Or will it turn back towards liberalism or another path entirely?"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The North German Federation survives on the skin of its teeth. In 1930, it was invaded by the fascists in France and the monarchists in Poland, and gave up the Rhineland after only six months of warfare. After this humiliating rout, Paul Meier, the beleaguered President, hopes to marshal Germany's survival in the face of further French aggression-- and mounting internal dissent. Will their democracy survive yet another conflict? Or will it fall victim to the fascists encroaching upon its borders?"
 HDA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Haida have seen their lands become the site of the two Great Wars. Though they have emerged victorious, the people are sick of war, and the army languishes from lack of recruits. To their east, the Ayiti Commune bestirs, and across the ocean, the conflict between China and Japan threatens their furthest holdings. Will the Haida play a decisive role, or will they splinter under the weight of domestic upheaval?"
 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Silla finds itself in an awkward and desperation position. Though a powerful country in its own right, with substantial holdings, the sudden and abrupt deterioriation of ties with the Ming leaves it desperate and its northern holdings isolated. Will it return to the Great Ming? Will it stay with the Japanese alliance? Or will it become something unexpected?"
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Da Qin, the greatest of the successor states to Chang Yuchun's old conquests, finds itself isolated. It is caught between the communist Byzantines and their great rivals in Somalia, and it knows it cannot face either of them alone. Will it join one of the established blocs of states, or will it create one of its own?"
