 one_rome_desc:0 "For too long have the weak, decadent Greeks squatted upon the ruins of Rome. For too long have they stood in our way. Their ideology, nay, their very existence is an insult. Draw up the plans for Operation Belisarius. We shall destroy them once and for all." 
 all_europa_under_rome:0 "All Europa Under Rome"
 all_europa_under_rome_desc:0 "The Roman Empire is the true, destined master of all Europe, the western counterweight to Chinese dominance of the east. We will strike down the squatters in Constantinople, but first we must unite the rest of Europe under our steady hand."
 the_german_question:0 "The German Question"

 greater_germania:0 "Greater Germania"
 greater_germania_desc:0 "Rome is generous to its friends, and Austria and Bavaria are little more than thorns in our sides. Even if we must tolerate the insult of the 'Holy Roman Empire' a little longer, finally reuniting Germany will make them a powerful member of our empire."
 invite_germany:0 "Invite Germany"
 invite_germany_desc:0 "The so-called 'Holy Roman Empire' proved itself worthy when it struck down the decadent liberals in Berlin, and a Central Europe wholly under our banner will show the inevitability of our vision. Let's do what our ancestors could not, and bring them into the fold."

 orleans_agreement:0 "The Orleans Agreement"
 orleans_agreement_desc:0 "Germania must be laid low, but we remember a time when it disappeared from the map, only for Britain and Byzantium to turn Europe into a charnel house until it reappeared. What if we could get what we wanted without firing a shot?"

 absorb_leon_desc:0 "We already rule most of Hispania Tarraconensis, and control of the Atlantic coast would be a boon. If we wish to bring Iberia fully into the fold, and end this pretence of an independent 'Lai Ang', this is the most logical place to start." 
 absorb_andalusia:0 "Annex Baetica"
 absorb_andalusia_desc:0 "All that remains is Hispania Baetica. The Iberians despair, and beg us to just finish it. Let us correct this mistake of history for good."
 absorb_algarve:0 "Annex Lusitania"
 absorb_algarve_desc:0 "Strabo says the Lusitani were the greatest of the Iberians, and put up the fiercest and most prolonged resistance against Rome. As Tarraconensis showed, our diplomats and political officers are more than equal to the task of reintegrating these wayward lambs."

 KOR_stay_with_allies:0 "Stay with Allies"
 KOR_stay_with_allies_desc:0 "Our drifting apart from the Ming was gradual, and then all at once.

 KOR_our_own_path:0 "Our Own Path"
 KOR_our_own_path_desc:0 "This alliance with Japan has proven not to be to our benefit, but a severe constriction on our foreign policy. This new policy has come under attack from the radical left and right, and even parts of the old scholar-bureaucratic establishment. We cannot go on like this."

 KOR_captains_of_industry:0 "Captains of Industry"
 KOR_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "The heads of major firms have come forward with a plea. They, too, are concerned about overbearing Chinese influence, and are willing to work in the national interest and subordinate their resources and expertise to the national good.

 KOR_join_ming_alliance:0 "Formal Military Alliance"
 KOR_join_ming_alliance_desc:0 "After some intense negotiations and reshuffling of the cabinet, we are prepared to come back to the Ming. They are likely going to ask for further concessions or some concrete gesture of loyalty, but it's a step we'll have to take."

After years of socialist governance, we can no longer assume that every commune or firm in an industrial sector has the same interests, nor that every union in each sector has the same interests.

 BYZ_italian_lines:0 "Italian Lines"
 BYZ_italian_lines_desc:0 "The Gauls look upon us with envy and hatred. They hate that the red flag of socialism flies over Rome.

 BYZ_regional_economic_integration:0 "Regional Economic Integration"

 BYZ_refining_techniques:0 "Refining Techniques"
 BYZ_refining_techniques_desc:0 "Our relationship with Azerbaijan is proving to be mutually beneficial. In exchange for investment in factories and infrastructure, they are willing to share more advanced oil refining technology for us to use for our deposits near Ploesti. A fair trade?"
 BYZ_align_da_qin:0 "Align Da Qin"
 BYZ_align_da_qin_desc:0 "Relations with Da Qin have been tense for centuries. Now they are only ambivalent. Perhaps now we could agree to avoid further tensions and safeguard at least one of our borders from foreign incursions."
 BYZ_prospects:0 "Prospects"
 BYZ_prospects_desc:0 "Our relationship with Da Qin, while not quite friendly, has significantly improved. We may yet reach an agreement on the drilling of some oil fields across the border and the construction of new pipelines. This may be the start of a beautiful relationship."

 BYZ_armaments_buildup_desc:0 "Our divisions, while numerous on paper, still have insufficient equipment. We will have to address this problem not just for our current armies, but for those we will call up in the future. We will need more factories devoted to armaments production."

 BYZ_mechanized_innovations:0 "Mechanized Innovations"
 BYZ_mechanized_innovations_desc:0 "We have seen the newsreels of the Gauls storming the German lines. We know that horses are not enough. We will need more motor vehicles to supply and transport our troops, and to rapidly exploit weakness in the enemy lines."

 BYZ_doctrinal_reforms:0 "Doctrinal Reforms"
 BYZ_doctrinal_reforms_desc:0 "While the Red Army had established itself as a successful counterinsurgency force in Nuevo Xi'an and Ireland, it still relies on army doctrines from the Second Great War in more conventional warfare, which may not be appropriate for the new era."
 BYZ_a_new_generation:0 "A New Generation"
 BYZ_a_new_generation_desc:0 "Our army command structure is top-heavy, with too many old guard members and political appointees at the top and too many bright young officers languishing at the rank of colonel or below. Many of them have considerable experience from the 'small wars' of the past decade. We will need to promote this younger, more energetic, group of leadership to lead a revolutionary army."
 BYZ_a_new_generation_tt:0 "New corps commanders will be available with higher average skills and levels."
 BYZ_general_staff_overhaul:0 "General Staff Overhaul"
 BYZ_general_staff_overhaul_desc:0 "The most important stage of our army reform will be the near-total reorganization of officer promotion, training, and assignments. Newer generations of leadership will be promoted from below, and rewarded from their merits and character under fire. They will not chosen because of their political connections or perceived loyalty."
 BYZ_cavalry_doctrines:0 "Cavalry Doctrines"
 BYZ_cavalry_doctrines_desc:0 "Some of our more radical officers are proposing a wholesale adaptation of Gallic military tactics - develop combined arms task forces, and punch through weak points in a line with concentrated cavalry. In this way, we can avoid a long slog like the First Great War."
 BYZ_antifascist_rhetoric:0 "Antifascist Rhetoric"
 BYZ_antifascist_rhetoric_desc:0 "We were not the first to oppose the rise of fascism. Labor movements within France were among those that most seriously resisted the rise of the tyrant who calls herself Valeria. The Germans, too, know only too well what Fascism brings. We should emphasize a broad alliance across and within societies to destroy this new threat. Furthermore, it could be a useful justification for forming alliances with the liberal powers."
 BYZ_recruitment_drive:0 "Recruitment Drive"
 BYZ_recruitment_drive_desc:0 "The majority of the Byantine people do not seriously want war. We will have to present a clear and unified message on the case for war - to defend the true freedoms of our commune, and to destroy that empire which threatens global peace and prosperity." 
 BYZ_public_works:0 "Public Works"

 BYZ_marxism_extebarrianism_desc:0 "Marxism-Extebarrianism, broadly defined, rejects over-centralization of the economy in a single institution or party (largely as a reaction to the failed Spyromilos coup of 1884), and stipulates the existence of multiple socialist tendencies in a 'generalized democracy'."
 BYZ_union_negotiations:0 "Union Negotiations"
 BYZ_union_negotiations_desc:0 "The labor unions have come a long way from the banned, marginalized institutions of fifty years ago.

 BYZ_political_pragmatism:0 "Political Pragmatism"
 BYZ_political_pragmatism_desc:0 "The main difference between our current tendency of socialist thought and its historical antecedents was a turn away from metaphysical dialectics and historical determinism. We cannot rely on laws or economic factors alone, but the imperfect decisions of human beings. We cannot wait for an 'inevitable' clash, we must bring it about ourselves."
 BYZ_organic_intelligentsia:0 "Organic Intelligentsia"
 BYZ_organic_intelligentsia_desc:0 "Our government has been uniquely responsive to popular demands and concerns. We hold elections not as a tool for maintaining bourgeois legitimacy, but for gauging what works, and realizing society's multifaceted needs."

 BYZ_a_shot_of_mullerism:0 "A Shot of Mullerism"
 BYZ_a_shot_of_mullerism_desc:0 "We are truly in desperate times. While our praxis has served us well enough for the past fifty years, we are facing existential threats and require a more militarized society. Perhaps we could learn from the Marathan model?"

 BYZ_all_state_unions:0 "All-State Unions"
 BYZ_all_state_unions_desc:0 "The labor unions have been a major player in Byzantine politics for too long, and they are starting to resent the party's growing hold on politics. We cannot allow them too much leeway, especially with the threat of war. They will have to follow our leadership."
 BYZ_state_planning_secretariat:0 "State-Planning Secretariat"
 BYZ_state_planning_secretariat_desc:0 "While we have had several economic committees in government before, large enterprises, even state-owned ones, were largely autonomous. We should instead centralize them and organize them into a more hierarchical system. We can set medium and long-term goals for increased outputs, which should be the chief aim of the plans."
 BYZ_democratic_centralism:0 "Democratic Centralism"
 BYZ_democratic_centralism_desc:0 "We have wasted too much time retaining the trappings of an old parliamentary democracy. Once the party leadership makes a decision, it should be binding upon all outside elements. We cannot let our system grow weak and exploited by outsiders."
 BYZ_iconoclasm:0 "Iconoclasm"
 BYZ_iconoclasm_desc:0 "The previous failures of Byzantine society were because we were insufficiently revolutionary. Too many institutions of the Republic -- even the old Empire! -- remain in place. We will destroy the last remnants of the old society and create a new one."
 BYZ_the_revolutionary_vanguard:0 "The Revolutionary Vanguard"
 BYZ_the_revolutionary_vanguard_desc:0 "Only the brightest, most politically conscious members of society will form a revolutionary organization.

 BYZ_our_first_and_oldest_friend_desc:0 "The British were the first to extend the hand of friendship to us after the revolution. For over fifty years, they have been our allies and friends, through times of conflict and of peace. In both Great Wars, and in half-a-dozen other places, they have fought alongside us and with unflagging devotion. Now they are under threat from the Gauls, and we will come to their aid."

 BYZ_lithuania_tt:0 "Lithuania will recieve land and coastal forts."
 BYZ_coup_austria:0 "Coup Austria"
 BYZ_coup_austria_desc:0 "Austria is the soft underbelly of the fascist powers. They still do not have a formal military alliance with the others, and Klara Valeria still has monarchist opponents who resent her seizure of power and the death of the Sultana. Perhaps we could stir up some provocateurs or sympathetic militias and cause the fall of that government."
 BYZ_coup_austria_tt:0 "We will approach Austrian monarchists, supporters of the late Sultana, and other disgruntled elements to launch a coup against the regime of Klara Valeria."
 BYZ_approach_germany:0 "Approach Germany"
 BYZ_approach_germany_desc:0 "The German liberals have proven themselves to be uncommonly tenacious in their struggle for autonomy against the fascist threat. Even if they are a bourgeois democracy, we believe it would be mutually beneficial to form some alliance with them - or barring that, a mutual defense treaty."
 BYZ_the_western_colossus:0 "The Western Colossus"
 BYZ_the_western_colossus_desc:0 "The end of the Second Great War led to the foundation of a new socialist government in Ayiti, permanently changing the global balance of power. Though they've had some growing pains, they are now a prosperous commune, with a large army and staggering industrial growth. Our ties have been close for some now, but now is the right time to formally invite them to our alliance."
 BYZ_neutralize_austria:0 "Neutralize Austria"
 BYZ_neutralize_austria_desc:0 "Austria is still the weakest of the continental fascists, and their long border makes them more susceptible to foreign invasions. We should destroy them now and restore Hungarian territories while they still have a chance. "

 BYZ_eurasian_policy_desc:0 "The European subcontinent, as we know, is only an appendage to the rest of Asia, and the Empire of Ming looms over every other nation on earth. We will need to prepare ourselves for this definitive clash of political systems unprecedented in the history of the world."
 BYZ_annex_da_qin:0 "Annex Da Qin"
 BYZ_annex_da_qin_desc:0 "We cannot trust the government of Da Qin to hold any promises. Their government is too unstable and their leadership talks in violent terms about opposing us when we are weak. They have to go."
 BYZ_annex_seljuks:0 "Annex Seljuks"
 BYZ_annex_seljuks_desc:0 "We cannot seriously allow a backwards monarchy to sit on some of the most valuable oil deposits in the world. The old regime has to be removed, and a military occupation will replace it."

 BYZ_east_asian_alliances:0 "East Asian Alliances"
 BYZ_east_asian_alliances_desc:0 "The Great Ming is too powerful for even our great Commune to take on alone. We will have to find some willing co-belligerent. On the one hand, there are the liberal democracies of Japan and their alliance, each clinging to colonial regimes and enshrining corruption. On the other, the Muellerist state of Marathas, which any sane observer would note is descending into unrestrined tyranny. We hold our nose and shake hands."
 BYZ_shake_hands_with_the_devil:0 "Shake Hands with the Devil"
 BYZ_shake_hands_with_the_devil_desc:0 "We have to choose our enemies and our friends. Historians will judge us for taking the side of one tyrant to destroy another.
