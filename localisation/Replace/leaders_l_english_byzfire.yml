## LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ##

#Austria
POLITICS_KLARA_VALERIA_DESC:0 "Klara 'Valeria' Ma, Proconsul of Austria, is the head of the first explicitly Fascist government on mainland Europe. Her government, which took power in the 1919-1920 March on Vienna that killed the Sultana, is triumphant but weary after a war with Hungary. The current government is less inclined to join any foreign misadventures, and so holds Valeria Postuma's ambitions of a new Roman empire (and with Austria as a subordinate partner) with distrust and suspicion."

#Ayiti
POLITICS_MAYNERI_NITAINO_DESC:0 "Mayneri Nitaino was Secretary of Industrial Development and governor of Borikén before his election. He represents a new generation of leadership in the history of Ayitian socialism. His time spent in disaster relief and rebuilding war-torn areas has made him a popular figure among a more cynical and disillusioned public. He is a veteran of the Second Great War, and has fostered many connections with the British and Byzantine left in a spirit of reconciliation and pan-socialist unity. His supporters are hopeful for his broad domestic agenda and his promises to unify the fractious commune, though he is notably evasive about foreign policy."
POLITICS_ESEHE_OHNESESESTSE_DESC:0 "Ese'he Ohnesesestse was an MP from the remote territories of the Ayitian northwest. He is the first liberal leader to take power in decades, and views the Sailors Union and the Ayiti Commune as corrupt socialist institutions to be dismantled. He yearns for a return to 'frontier liberalism'."

#Azerbaijan
POLITICS_AZIM_DERYA_DESC:0 "Azim Derya was the head of the Azeri state oil company and served as Minister of Energy for two years. He holds a committed belief in the power of free markets and free trade, meaning in practice he is willing to set aside ideological differences and make export deals with any of his neighbors to fund Azerbaijan's economic growth."

#Bavaria
POLITICS_GAIUS_JULIUS_DABERTZHOFEN_DESC:0 "Gaius Julius Dabertzhofen, born Erich von Dabertzhofen, is the Governor-General of occupied Bavaria. He was chosen because of his loyalty and unswerving obedience to his Gallic masters."

#British Congo
POLITICS_RICHARD_TOUZAYAMOKO_DESC:0 "Richard Touzayamoko is the first elected president of the British Dominion of the Congo. He previously served as a majority whip in the Shetland-on-Congo Parliament and was a principal negotiator in the Humphrey-Dacko Treaty of 1935. His ambitious for the Congo involve land policy, reorganizing the Congolese government in preparation for independence, and enforcing labor rights law."

#Byzantium
POLITICS_IOULIANA_ERDEMIR_DESC:0 "A decorated naval veteran and a one-term MP from Athens, Iouliana Erdemir rose to power from the total obscurity of a hardscrabble farming commune. She is an energetic and popular reformer, given to radio speeches and touring the country by airplane. She is an established hawk in foreign policy, having advocated for the Red Army to be intervene in Ireland, and she has seen a massive expansion of the land forces from their underfunded and under-equipped state of the late 1920s. This is presented to the electorate as a purely defensive measure, as the older cadres remember the terrible bloodlettings of the two great wars. Byzantium yearns for peace, and so prepares for war."
POLITICS_THEODORA_PAPADOPOULOU_DESC:0 "One of the last serving fighters from the revolution of 1884 and the Commune's most famous general, Theodora Papadopoulou has been drafted as a figurehead leader by the shadowy clique that calls itself the 'Communist Party of Byzantium'. Why did she accept? Likely out of her sense of duty. It was, after all, that same sense of duty that led her to stay and fight on after the slaughter of ten thousand of her fellow comrades in the last days of the republic. It was duty that made her stay after seeing the killing fields of the First and Second Great War. It is duty that made her stay after the Ekklesia was shuttered and the protestors were shot in the street. She makes ready for one last battle, even though the old Commune is dead."

#Gaul
POLITICS_VALERIA_POSTUMA_DESC:0 "Valeria 'Postuma', as she is called by her political opponents, took power in 1933 after the assassination of her predecessor by a young socialist. Although she lacks the philosophical, even mystical, inclinations of the previous leader, this Valeria has an outstanding military career and was instrumental in the conquest of the Rhine in 1931. \n\nThose outside of the Imperium would mock her for assuming the name and style of her predecessor, but they do not understand the nature of this new regime. Valeria is not just a name. Valeria is a title. Valeria is a symbol, a woman out of myth. Valeria is the warrior saint of centuries past who took Jerusalem and Alexandria and united Christendom, and Valeria is the crusader of today. Valeria will wipe Europe clean and establish a new order to then take the world."

#Germany
POLITICS_KUNIGUNDE_VON_STARSCHEDEL_DESC:0 "The last surviving member of a once proud noble family, Kunigunde von Starschedel drifted to fascism after observing its rise in Gaul and denouncing the 'weaknesses' of the North German Federation. A fierce ultra-nationalist, she is resentful of both pangalist and communist influences. She harbors grandiose visions of German expansion and calls for the restoration of a Holy Roman Empire."

#Ghana
POLITICS_AKWESI_KONADU_DESC:0 "An ethnic Akan, Konadu was educated at the University of Athens and his father was a major figure in the Moussa government from 1907-1911. As foreign minister from 1930-1934, Konadu has played a role in negotiating the eventual independence of the British Congo. As Prime Minister, he has focused on improving the more isolated and pastoral north, and keeping a close eye on Somali aggression."

#Great Britain
POLITICS_MARY_NAPIER_DESC:0 "After years of being hamstrung by the opposition, the Labour Party - specifically the radical wing of the Labour Party - have taken a majority in Parliament. Mary Napier has trumpeted vast ambitioms for reforming the domestic economy, but she is caught between domestic reforms on the one hand and rebuilding the navy and air force in response to Fascist aggression."

#Holland
POLITICS_HENDRICUS_VROHUIS_DESC:0 "Hendricus Vrohuis was a marginal and often-mocked figure in Dutch politics before Valeria marched their armies up to the border. Now he is in charge, an able and eager collaborator. He is still mocked, but now also hated."

#Hungary
POLITICS_JUHASZ_ZSIGMOND_DESC:0 "Juhász Zsigmond's regime has been derided by critics as a 'garrison state' or 'barracks communism'. He views his regime's centralization and militarization as necessary after the defeat against Austria and the looming threat of fascist expansion. He quarrels with the Byzantines on all matters of domestic policy and civil rights, but he tolerates their criticism and fears being left behind as the 'soft underbelly' of the Red Rose Pact."

#Iceland
POLITICS_BENEDIKT_HILMIRSSON_DESC:0 "Benedikt Hilmirsson leads the Icelandic fascist state. His party, unusual among European fascists, makes no pretenses towards restoring the Roman Empire in any form. Instead it calls for a return to an old Norse pastoral state. It is suspected that they were invited into the Western Roman Empire not because of their army or massive industrial base, but from its strategic location and functioning port."

#Ireland
POLITICS_AOIFE_O_CONNOR_DESC:0 "Aoife O'Connor, of County Galway, is the first elected leader of Ireland after the long period of The Troubles. She saw street fighting in the battles outside Dublin in 1930, and soon became a major leader of the PNE due to rapid turnover of leadership. She was soon expelled from the party by rivals for taking a 'collaborationist' view towards liberal parties in promoting a peace treaty. As a result, she founded her own political faction with former PNE members, intent upon a negotiated peace and general truce. This made her an appealling partner to the Byzantines, and when their army finally intervened, she found herself with a powerful mediator ready to set the backdrop for talks. The peace has held, and O'Connor was elected by a narrow margin."

#Leon/Iberia
POLITICS_GABRIELA_FATIMA_HU_DESC:0 "Admiral Gabriela Fatima Hu became Praetor of the Kingdom of Leon after the sudden death of her predecessor in 1934. She stresses her state's 'Latin' character and espouses a specific 'Iberian Fascism', which is claimed to be distinct from the later Gallic type. She is strongly opposed to Valeria Postuma's ambitions of a single unitary state, and believes her Romanized Leon should retain its independence."

#Lithuania
POLITICS_KASPARAS_SEREIKIS_DESC:0 "Kasparas Sereikis is in a uniquely difficult position. His Mullerist one-party state is surrounded on all sides by right-wing regimes which outnumber his state in both industrial output and the size of the standing army. He has appealed to the Red Rose Pact for equipment and extra troops but they both know the survival of his regime may be measured in days, even hours, when war comes. And still they fight."

#Marathas
POLITICS_RISHMA_SHARQI_COM_DESC:0 "Rishma I Sharqi, 'The Sphinx of Mumbai', has led her state through an economic and political transformation unprecedented in recent history. An absolute monarch has declared her state's 'total committment' to socialist industrialization, and has stated that 'war communism' is the only possible path for the Marathi state's survival through impossible odds. However, she has not given up much political power, and cynics claim the only difference is that she is now called Comrade instead of Maharani. However, she still controls a large and modernized army and commands the destiny of hundreds of millions, and so she remains a dominant figure in South Asian affairs."

#Nova Scotia
POLITICS_DUNCAN_MCDOUGALL_DESC:0 "Duncan McDougall was Minister for Railways for years, and played a pivotal role in supply and aiding refugees during the Second Great War. As Prime Minister, he has engineered the construction of a modern welfare state, and improved relations with the Haida and Ayiti as well as investing in the Prairie provinces. His personal charisma, combined with his reputation as a modernizing technocrat, contribute to his well-liked status as a Nova Scotian leader."

#Nuevo Xian
POLITICS_XIAOPING_MURAD_DESC:0 "A decade after the failed ultra-nationalist uprisings of the Pampas War, Nuevo Xi'an is a quiet and peaceful nation. Xiaoping Murad presides over a stable government with little need to get involved in foreign affairs besides trading with the Inca and Anacaona. She advocates closer ties to the Byzantine Commune and continuing industrialization along the Byzantine model."

#Poland
POLITICS_STANISLAUS_DE_VALOIS_VEXIN_DESC:0 "Stanislaus II de Valois-Vexin is the reigning king of Poland. His regime was humiliated after the disastrous performance in the war against Germany, and the ongoing invasion of Bohemia is perceived in the international community as compensating for this earlier weakness. He faces intense pressure from Valeria, who has already overthrown the other branch of his family in France, and the military, who view him as weak and ineffectual."

#Bohemia
POLITICS_VLADAN_I_ZUKAL_DESC:0 "Vladan I of Bohemia is a rare European monarch who has stubbornly clung to absolute power while still taking an avowed antifascist stance in both domestic and international politics. His reign has not been without controversy, such as his clashes with democratising elements in Bohemia and the downright anachronistic nature of his government, but he is popular at home for his focus on citizens' welfare, domestic development, and promoting Bohemian culture. Bohemia is a respectable name in the arts and sciences despite its size, for example, and even performed admirably in the 1932 Olympics, while Prague is a popular tourist destination. Unfortunately, none of this helped when Poland issued a declaration of war in the final hours of 1935, and the prognosis looks grim for Bohemia."

#Third Rome/Russia
POLITICS_YEKATERINA_CESKA_LIPA_DESC:0 "Yekaterina V Ceska Lipa has been the Tsaritsa of Russia since 1919. Over the past decades, she has pursued a policy of 'cultural authenticity'. In theory, this means eschewing both capitalist and communist economics, the promotion of hyperconservative Christianity, a return to the heritage of the Kiev-Byzantium period, and raising claims on Tsargrad (i.e. Byzantion). The result is a country still desperately impoverished and backward, but with a large but ill-equipped army and claims against the Great Ming and Byzantium."

#Asitelahan
POLITICS_LIU_KESAN_DESC:0 "International oil and haidagraph magnate Liu Kesan has never been convicted of anything concrete, but he is one of history's most infamous and powerful Triad bosses. Liu's criminal empire spans the entire world and wields significant influence over just about every racket one could think of, and his obscene wealth and wide ranging connections made him a key player in the Business Plot. Asitelahan's newfound independence in the aftermath is widely believed to be payment for services rendered, as is Liu's subsequent rise to political power, although other rumours suggest this is his way of trying to go legitimate. Although Asitelahan is an autocratic petrostate with a pretence of republican government at best, it has been developing a mighty economy under his rule, as well as a robust social welfare sector." 

#Zhongnan
POLITICS_CAO_LIUXIAN_DESC:0 "What is Cao Liuxian doing in charge of a country? Armed with a University of Athens education and a ruthless streak he picked up in the Chinese Army, he is a cunning manipulator with a talent for administration and quickly making vast amounts of money, prior to the Business Plot he had never shown any interest in politics, preferring to flaunt his wealth and increase his family's vicegrip on the global rubber trade. One popular theory is that he has some kind of personal relationship with Zhang Zhulin. On paper, Cao has done well - the economy is booming and Bangkok presents a pleasant, highly-developed face for the international community. On closer inspection, virtually all the rewards of such are going straight into the pockets of the Chinese ruling class, and Cao is shockingly obvious about using his position for self-enrichment. He treats the subcontinent as his personal fiefdom, and as his greed and hedonism run amok his policies could end up tossing a lit match onto the Indochinese powderkeg."
