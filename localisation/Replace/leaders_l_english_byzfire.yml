## LEADER DESCRIPTIONS ##

#Ayiti
POLITICS_MAYNERI_NITAINO_DESC:0 "Mayneri Nitaino was former Secretary of Industrial Development for the Ayiti Commune, and is the youngest elected leader in the history of Ayiti. He is a veteran of the Second Great War, and has fostered many connections with the British and Byzantine left-wing in a spirit of reconciliation and pan-socialist unity. While his many critics allege that he is too inexperienced and too eager to get involved in foreign interventions, his supporters are hopeful for his broad domestic agenda and his promises to unify the fractious commune and listen to those voices that feel silenced."

#Azerbaijan
POLITICS_AZIM_DERYA_DESC:0 "Azim Derya was the former head of the Azeri state oil company and served as Minister of Energy for two years. He holds a committed belief in the power of free markets and free trade, meaning in practice he is willing to set aside ideological differences and make export deals with any of his neighbors to fund Azerbaijan's economic growth."

#Gaul
POLITICS_VALERIA_POSTUMA_DESC:0 "Valeria 'Postuma', as she is called by her political opponents, took power in 1933 after the assassination of her predecessor by a young socialist. Although she lacks the philosophical, even mystical, inclinations of the previous leader, this Valeria has an outstanding military career and was instrumental in the conquest of the Rhine in 1931. \n-\n-Those outside of the Imperium would mock her for assuming the name and style of her predecessor, but they do not understand the nature of this new regime. Valeria is not just a name. Valeria is a title. Valeria is a symbol. Valeria is the warrior saint of centuries past who took Jerusalem, and Valeria is the crusader of today. Valeria will wipe Europe clean and establish a new order to then take the world."

#Germany
POLITICS_PAUL_MEIER_DESC:0 "Once a stalwart conservative, Paul Meier bolted to the liberal New Julians in 1931 after the disgraceful two-month war against the French. After a series of short-lived governments, Meier was first appointed Foreign Minister, where he managed to negotiate economic treaties with the Red Rose Pact. He survived multiple cabinet shuffles, and was elected President in 1933 on pledge to defend the German federation and its liberties against all external threats. He knows the task ahead of him seems insurmountable, but he remains committed to preserving democratic liberalism."
POLITICS_KUNIGUNDE_VON_STARSCHEDEL_DESC:0 "The last surviving member of a once proud noble family, Kunigunde von Starschedel drifted to fascism after observing its rise in Gaul and denouncing the 'weaknesses' of the North German Federation. A fierce ultra-nationalist, she is resentful of both pangalist and communist influences. She harbors grandiose visions of German expansion and calls for the restoration of a Holy Roman Empire."


#Japan 
POLITICS_MASAOKA_NATSUKO_DESC:0 "One of the few leaders of the Jiyuutou who was politically unscathed after the disastrous war with China, Masaoka has predicated her administration on domestic reconstruction, forming new alliances with remaining liberal democracies, and assuaging big business against Chinese aggression. Who would have imagined that the MP once derided as a 'Niigata shopkeeper' would become liberal democracy's staunch defender?"

#Marathas
POLITICS_RISHMA_SHARQI_COM_DESC:0 "Rishma I Sharqi, 'The Sphinx of Mumbai', has led her state through an economic and political transformation unprecedented in recent history. An absolute monarch has declared her state's 'total committment' to socialist industrialization, and has stated that 'war communism' is the only possible path for the Marathi state's survival through impossible odds. However, she has not given up much political power, and cynics claim the only difference is that she is now called Comrade instead of Maharani. However, she still controls a large army and commands the destiny of hundreds of millions, and so she remains a dominant figure in South Asian affairs."

#Somalia
POLITICS_ADEY_WALASHMA_DESC:0 "One of the new generation of 'rule by consensus' leaders that took power after the death and deposal of Lord Protector Maxamad Muzaffar, Adey Walashma has presided over a series of successful economic reforms and put down a major rebellion in Buganda. She believes that China and Somalia have mutual interests in both economic development and foreign policy, in contrast to other clan leaders and heads who would favor ties with Japan. She is also a devoted anti-Communist, and is suspicious of Ghanian and Byzantine motives and interests."
