 germany.4.a:0 "How can anyone say that Austria is not German?!"
 germany.5.t:0 "Anti-Comintern Pact"
 germany.5.d:0 "Germany proposes that we sign a pact recognizing that the aim of the Communist International, known as the Comintern, is to disintegrate and subdue existing States by all the means at its command; convinced that the toleration of interference by the Communist International in the internal affairs of the nations not only endangers their internal peace and social well-being, but is also a menace to the peace of the world desirous of co-operating in the defense against Communist subversive activities."
 germany.5.a:0 "Join"
 germany.5.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.6.t:0 "The Tripartite Pact"
 germany.6.d:0 "The signees consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned."

 germany.11.t:0 "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 germany.11.d:0 "The German Foreign Ministry have proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade, and an additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres.\n\nWhile the fascists in Berlin may not be trustworthy, this pact will allow us to deal with Finland, the Baltic States and Romania without fear of outside interference. The eastern territories of Poland will also befall us in the event of a Polish collapse."
 germany.11.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
 germany.11.a.tt:0 "§RWhile the pact is in effect, the Closed Economy trade policy will be unavailable.\nThe War With Germany focus will be unavailable for two years.§!\n"
 germany.11.b:0 "No deals with the fascists!"
 germany.12.t:0 "Moscow Signs the Pact"
 germany.12.d:0 "The Soviet Union has wisely agreed to sign our non-aggression pact. This means that we are free to act without risk of Soviet intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question Germany's commitment towards the ultimate destruction of communism. When matters with Poland and France have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.13.t:0 "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d:0 "The Soviet Union has refused to sign our non-aggression pact! This complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with Poland or France without the risk of the Bolsheviks getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a:0 "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t:0 "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.d:0 "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the Soviet sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Should we withdraw our forces and let the Soviets occupy this territory? Failure to do so would render our treaty void."
 germany.14.a:0 "Yes. Treaty stipulations must be obeyed."
 germany.14.b:0 "No! All of Poland belongs to the Vaterland!"
 germany.15.t:0 "Germany Honors the Pact"
 germany.15.d:0 "In accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, German forces have evacuated eastern Poland and our own troops have moved in to occupy the territory."
 germany.16.t:0 "Germany Betrays the Pact"
 germany.16.d:0 "Germany has refused to partition Poland with us, in a blatant violation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact! This betrayal has rendered our treaty with them null and void!"
 germany.16.a:0 "We were fools to trust the fascists!"
 germany.20.t:0 "Second Vienna Award"
 germany.20.d:0 "Recognizing that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by Hungary and Romania to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries. Transylvania was taken from Hungary and incorporated into Romania in one of the many ill-conceived changes forced upon the world at Versailles. Should Northern Transylvania be returned to Hungarian control?"
 germany.20.a:0 "Give Hungary Northern Transylvania."
 germany.20.b:0 "Give Hungary all of Transylvania."
 germany.20.c:0 "Transylvania shall remain in Romania."
 germany.21.t:0 "Romania Rejects Our Verdict"

 germany.21.a:0 "The will of Germany must be obeyed!"
 germany.22.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Folds"
 germany.22.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has agreed to our demands, and Memel will be incorporated back into East Prussia. Yet another unlawfully stolen province has been returned to the German nation!"
 germany.22.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.23.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Refuses Demand"
 germany.23.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has refused our demands! They are hiding behind the Klaipeda Convention, claiming that Germany has no legal right to the Memel territory. We shall have to explain our position to them by different means..."
 germany.23.a:0 "Stubborn fools."
 germany.24.t:0 "German Military Mission to China"
 germany.24.d:0 "Germany has enjoyed good relations with China since the end of the previous Weltkrieg, despite the loss of our Chinese possessions. A German military mission has been present in China for a number of years, and Alexander von Falkenhausen has made great progress in reforming parts of the Kuomintang army.\n\nThis is naturally of some concern to the Japanese, given their present war against China. They are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all German support to the Chinese."
 germany.24.a:0 "Recall von Falkenhausen."
 germany.24.b:0 "No, our advisors will stay."
 germany.25.t:0 "Military Advisors Recalled"
 germany.25.d:0 "Deteriorating relations with China has made it politically unfeasible to maintain a military mission in their country. Alexander von Falkenhausen and the rest of our advisors have been recalled."
 germany.25.a:0 "We shall put him to work."
 germany.26.t:0 "China Detains Military Advisors"
 germany.26.d:0 "Germany and China are in a state of war, and the Chinese have consequently detained the German military advisors that reforming their army. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his officers managed to elude capture, and are now on their way back to Europe."
 germany.26.a:0 "Good man!"
 germany.27.t:0 "Fortifying the Westwall"
 germany.27.d:0 "Army pioneers have finished their survey of our existing fortifications, and identified the locations where they should be strengthened. The necessary construction orders have been placed."
 germany.27.a:0 "This will hold better than the Siegfried Line."
 germany.28.t:0 "Germans press for Anschluss"
 germany.28.d:0 "Civil unrest and acts of violence have broken out as protesters voice their desire for Austria to join Germany in a union of German peoples. Berlin is pressing hard for an Anschluss, which would see Austria annexed into their nation."
 germany.28.a:0 "We shall join the German Reich!"
 germany.28.b:0 "No, Austria's destiny lies elsewhere."
 germany.29.t:0 "Austria refuses the Anschluss!"
 germany.29.d:0 "The fools in Vienna have refused to accept the merger of our two nations! This is a blatant disregard for the will of the Austrian people, and it will not stand! We may have to enforce the Anschluss through military means."
 germany.29.a:0 "We must prepare for a military intervention."
 germany.40.t:0 "The Munich Conference"
 germany.40.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. Hitler has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the British position be?"
 germany.40.d_2:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. Hitler has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. As we have already proven that we won't accept German expansionism, this means we now have another ally in the war against Germany."
 germany.40.a:0 "The Czechs are on their own."
 germany.40.b:0 "Czechoslovakia must be defended!"
 germany.41.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. Hitler has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have made it clear that they have no intention of going to war over a 'quarrel in a far-away country.' Should we follow their lead, or will we honor our obligations to Czechoslovakia by offering them support?"
 germany.41.a:0 "Leave the Czechs to their fate."
 germany.41.b:0 "The British be damned! France supports her friends!"
 germany.42.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. Hitler has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have refused to back down, and are instead threatening the Germans with war if they violate Czechoslovakia's borders. War may be imminent."
 germany.42.a:0 "We must prepare!"
 germany.42.b:0 "France should stay out of this."
 germany.43.t:0 "France leaves the Allies"
 germany.43.d:0 "The stubborn French have refused to follow our lead in the Sudeten Crisis! They stand by their support of Czechoslovakia, and since we do not they have decided to rescind our mutual alliance. Even now, France is preparing for an imminent war with Germany."
 germany.43.a:0 "Fools! Hitler must be appeased!"
 germany.44.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nFortunately, it looks like the Allies will stand by their earlier promises of support. They have threatened Hitler with war if our borders are violated in the slightest. Despite this, we must prepare for an imminent German attack."
 germany.44.a:0 "Good! Let them come!"
 germany.45.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nThe British cowards have refused to back our sovereignty, but at least the French are sticking up for us! They have abandoned their alliance with Britain and formed a new one with us, promising to support Czechoslovakia against German aggression."
 germany.45.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 germany.46.t:0 "The Munich Diktat"
 germany.46.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nBoth the British and French have rescinded their earlier promises to support us against German aggression. Their diplomats have made it clear that if we choose to resist the Germans, we do so on our own. Perhaps we have no choice but to surrender the Sudetenland..."
 germany.46.a:0 "This is a dark day for Europe."
 germany.46.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
 germany.47.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British and their Allies have both rejected our rightful claims to the Sudetenland, and they have threatened us with war if we 'violate' the Czech border!\n\nA plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia has been drawn up, but this will likely trigger a general European war. We must make certain we are ready for this."
 germany.47.a:0 "Time to do this the hard way."
 germany.48.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British have seen reason and accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, but the stubborn French are refusing to back down.\n\nThey have abandoned their cooperation with Britain and forged closer ties with the Czechs instead. It looks like we will have to deal with them both at the same time, but at least now the British hopefully won't intervene..."
 germany.48.a:0 "This may work to our advantage."
 germany.49.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nDespite the hopelessness of their situation, the stubborn Czechs are refusing to surrender their territory! We will have to take it by force. An invasion plan has been prepared that will wipe this vile experiment of Versailles off the face of the Earth!"
 germany.49.a:0 "The Czechs must be destroyed."
 germany.50.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nRecognizing the hopelessness of their situation, the Czechs have surrendered the Sudeten territories to us. Their oppressed German inhabitants will at long last be brought into the Vaterland!"
 germany.50.a:0 "This is a historic day for Germany."
 germany.51.t:0 "First Vienna Award"
 germany.51.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is a cancer tumor in the heart of Europe, and at last the Germans have decided to take decisive action against them. The Sudetenland has already been surrendered to Germany, and now, as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovakian territory that rightfully belongs to Hungary is to be returned to us."
 germany.51.a:0 "About time!"
 germany.52.t:0 "The Annexation of Zaolzie"
 germany.52.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is falling apart, and we must act quickly to protect territory with significant Polish populations before it can be seized by Germany. Czech ownership of Zaolzie has always been contested by us, and it is time for the region to join our nation."
 germany.52.a:0 "Zaolzie is ours!"
 germany.53.t:0 "The Fate of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.53.d:0 "Not content with stealing the Sudetenland, the Germans have now decided to seize the rest of our nation. Abandoned by our so-called allies, and with our best defenses lost in the Munich Diktat, the situation appears hopeless..."
 germany.53.a:0 "Give in to the Germans."
 germany.53.b:0 "...yet still we must resist!"
 germany.54.t:0 "The Czechs Resist"
 germany.54.d:0 "The Czechs have somehow mustered the courage to fight our occupation of their country. Their best defenses were in the Sudetenland, which is now under our control, so this should be a swift campaign."
 germany.54.a:0 "Prague will soon be ours."
 germany.55.d:0 "The end of Czechoslovakia is at hand, and our forces are marching into Prague at this very moment. With the surrender of the Czechoslovakian military, we have liberated vast quantities of armaments. Their tanks, in particular, should serve our forces well.\n\nBöhmen will be annexed into Germany as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.d_2:0 "Having conquered Czechoslovakia, we must consider the best way to split up these territories.\n\nBöhmen remains German as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.a:0 "Set up Slovakia as a puppet state."
 germany.55.b:0 "Partition Czechoslovakia with Hungary."
 germany.55.c:0 "All of Czechoslovakia belongs to the Reich!"
 germany.56.t:0 "The Partition of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.56.d:0 "German forces have entered Prague and the end of Czechoslovakia is imminent. They intend to annex Bohemia into the German Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.d_2:0 "After annexing Czechoslovakia, Germany is intending to retain Bohemia as part of the Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.a:0 "Of course! Greater Hungary will soon be a reality!"
 germany.56.b:0 "No, we do not need Slovakia or German friendship."
 germany.57.t:0 "Hungary Rejects Our Offer"
 germany.57.d:0 "The Hungarians have outrageously refused our generous offer to annex Slovakia, claiming they have no interest in the region! We will have to deal with them soon enough. For now, we must come up with a solution to the Slovakian Question."
 germany.57.a:0 "Set up Tiso's puppet government."
 germany.57.b:0 "Annex Slovakia into Germany."
 germany.58.t:0 "The Polish Question"
 germany.58.d:0 "The Reichsministerium of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has done an excellent job, and the people of Germany - indeed, the entire world - has been informed of the injustices our German brethren in Poland are forced to endure. We now have all the justification we need for a war!"
 germany.58.a:0 "Soon Poland will be no more!"
 germany.60.t:0 "The Remilitarization of the Rhineland"
 germany.60.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region! Unless we issue an ultimatum demanding their withdrawal, the treaty will not be enforced."
 germany.60.a:0 "This is an act of war! Rally the British to our side!"
 germany.60.a.tt:0 "§RIf war breaks out, we will suffer a civil war due to our §YDisjointed Government:§!\n"
 germany.60.b:0 "Issue a diplomatic objection."
 germany.61.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French are mobilizing their forces, and seem intent on issuing an ultimatum. If Germany refuses, they are prepared to advance into Germany to deal with this threat. Popular opinion in Britain is against a war, but if we refuse to stand by the French our alliance with them will be dissolved."
 germany.61.a:0 "A war is out of the question."
 germany.61.b:0 "We must stand by France!"
 germany.62.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French seem content to limit their response to this breach to diplomatic objections, and public opinion in Britain is firmly against a war."
 germany.62.a:0 "We will issue an objection as well."
 germany.63.t:0 "Britain Refuses War"
 germany.63.d:0 "The British are refusing to support us against Germany, claiming that the Germans are 'simply walking in their own backyard.' If we go to war with them, it looks like we will be on our own.\n\nPublic opinion in France is against a war, but Germany will only grow stronger and the remilitarization of the Rhineland constitutes a direct threat against our borders. Issuing an ultimatum would be less threatening without Britain on our side. Should we proceed against them alone?"
 germany.63.a:0 "Yes! Germany must be dealt with now."
 germany.63.b:0 "No, without the British we must back down..."
 germany.64.t:0 "Britain Supports Us"
 germany.64.d:0 "Though popular support for a war is lacking in Britain, the British government has recognized the threat posed by the Germans and they have offered us their full support. We will issue a final ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from the demilitarized zone. If they refuse, it is time for our forces to drive deep into Germany and put an end to their tyrannical regime!"
 germany.64.a:0 "Onwards!"
 germany.65.t:0 "France and Britain Mobilize!"
 germany.65.d:0 "The British and French have refused to accept the remilitarization of the Rhineland, calling it an 'unforgivable breach' of the Versailles Treaty. They are mobilizing their forces against us and have issued an ultimatum that our forces back down at once and the Rhineland remains demilitarized, or our nations are at war."
 germany.65.a:0 "We cannot back down! The Reich must be defended!"
 germany.65.b:0 "We are unprepared for this confrontation. We must back down."
 germany.66.t:0 "France Mobilizes!"
 germany.66.d:0 "The British have seen reason and accepted the remilitarization of the Rhineland, but the mad French are refusing to back down! Claiming that this incident constitutes a direct threat against the security of their nation, they are mobilizing their forces and may sweep in across the border at any moment! We are at war!"
 germany.67.t:0 "France Backs Down"
 germany.67.d:0 "The French wisely chose to back down when they realized that their mad enterprise wouldn't enjoy British support. Their forces have been demobilized and war has been averted for now. By golly, that was a close one!"
 germany.67.a:0 "A war now would be madness."
 germany.68.t:0 "France Refuses to Back Down"
 germany.68.d:0 "The French have stubbornly decided to go at it alone against the Germans, and our alliance with them has been rescinded. Yet another European war has broken out due to pointless squabbling. Perhaps it is time for Britain to distance itself from continental affairs again..."
 germany.68.a:0 "Perhaps it was inevitable."
 germany.70.t:0 "The Oster Conspiracy"
 germany.70.d:0 "Believing that Hitler has pushed Germany into a war it cannot win, a group of senior officers within the Wehrmacht have launched a coup! It appears to have been orchestrated by Colonel Hans Oster of the Abwehr, but generals Beck, von Brauchitsch, Halder and Admiral Canaris have also been confirmed as involved!\n\nHeavily-armed men lying in wait in several Berlin apartments have converged on the Reichskanzlei intent on liquidating Hitler and his closest associates. A fierce gun battle is currently raging inside the building."
 germany.70.a:0 "Protect the Führer at all costs!"
 germany.71.t:0 "The Führer is Dead"
 germany.71.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, but not before the dogs managed to kill Hitler! The Führer was found with several dozen gunshot wounds slumped over his desk - working tirelessly for the Vaterland to his last breath, no doubt!\n\nThe surviving conspirators will stand trial for their heinous crime, but for now Germany is at war and a new leader is needed. Who shall be the next Führer?"
 germany.71.a:0 "Herr Himmler will lead us into the future."
 germany.71.b:0 "Herr Göring is the logical choice."
 germany.72.t:0 "The Conspiracy Fails"
 germany.72.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, and Hitler himself led the clean-up effort with his trusty Luger. Miraculously, the Führer emerged from the fighting with only a few scratches.\n\nThe surviving conspirators will pay a steep price for their disloyalty, and Hitler is now even more committed towards prosecuting the current war towards a glorious victory!"
 germany.72.a:0 "Long live the Führer!"
 germany.73.t:0 "The Conspiracy Succeeds"
 germany.73.d:0 "The heavy fighting in the Reichskanzlei has reduced the building to a burning ruin. Despite a large number of SS soldiers rushing to Hitler's aid, army units loyal to the conspirators joined the fray and proved decisive. The Führer has been confirmed as killed, and the conspirators have successfully stormed all government buildings in Berlin.\n\nA large portion of the Wehrmacht has gone over to the other side, but many officers are still NSDAP loyalists. Who should be leading them?"
 germany.73.a:0 "Death to National Socialism!"
 germany.73.b:0 "Himmler will turn this around!"
 germany.73.c:0 "Göring is our only hope at this point!"
 germany.74.t:0 "Preparing the Ground"
 germany.74.d:0 "The Austrians are yearning to become part of the German Reich, but the stubborn government in Vienna has so far resisted all attempts to bring about a union. We must increase support for fascism in Austria. The Austrian Nazi Party will then become a viable alternative to the ruling austrofascists.\n\nAn Abwehr agent has been made available for an espionage mission. Use him to covertly increase popular support for fascism in Austria."
 germany.74.a:0 "Austria will be ours!"
 germany.75.t:0 "German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.75.d:0 "Despite harsh previous rhetoric against both the people and the ideological leadership of the [Root.GetName], [From.GetLeader] and Germany has now reached out to us, requesting a mutually beneficial research treaty. While exchanging knowledge would help our efforts to develop new tank designs along with promises of other research benefits in the future, there is little doubt considering previous statements that the Germans are doing this for their own sake. Should we go forward with the agreement despite the risk of aiding [From.GetLeader]'s ambitions?"
 germany.75.a:0 "The capitalists are a worse threat to us both."
 germany.75.b:0 "We won't give fascists the weapons to crush the proletariat!"
 germany.76.t:0 "Soviets Accept German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.76.d:0 "Our negotiations with the [From.GetName] have been successful. An agreement has been reached where our nations will aid each other in the development of new armored units, with a possible extension to other research areas in the future."
 germany.76.a:0 "This treaty will be a stepping stone to the future."
 germany.77.t:0 "Soviets Reject German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.77.d:0 "The [From.GetName] has rejected our suggestion for a treaty aimed at advancing armored unit research in both countries, presumably fearing our superior weapons would be turned against them."
 germany.77.a:0 "They have hardly diminished the risks of it now."
 germany.78.t:0 "German Joint Air Research"
 germany.78.d:0 "As stipulated by the treaty with Germany, some of their special research projects share discoveries with our engineers. A recent breakthrough in radar technology has come to our attention, opening up unexpected opportunities to advance our research in the field."
 germany.78.a:0 "Detecting the enemy is the first step."
 germany.79.t:0 "Ultimatum from Germany"
 germany.79.d:0 "With Greece under the thumb of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has put pressure on our government to join their ranks. The Soviet-German alliance has put us in a position where neutrality is no longer an option, and now an ultimatum has arrived from Berlin demanding we cede our eastern territories to their Soviet allies and join them in the very pact they are using to force our hand.\n\nAlthough we cannot maintain neutrality, there are other options. Seeking support from Britain is one, standing our ground is another. None, however, can secure the future of the republic with certainty."
 germany.79.a:0 "If we work with the Germans, we may find the opportunity to reclaim other land."
 germany.79.b:0 "We can count on British support, and they can count on us."
 germany.79.c:0 "If these despots want to take our home, they have to fight for it."
 germany.80.t:0 "Danzig for Slovakia"
 germany.80.d:0 "The Germans have long had their eyes on Danzig, seeking to unite their territories in Ostpreussen with the rest of the German nation. Diplomats have warned that the day may come when they make us choose between Danzig or war.\n\nSurprisingly, we have been presented with what the Germans consider a more peaceful solution. They offer the newly created state of Slovakia, currently little more than a puppet state under German rule, to us in exchange for Danzig. \nWhat steps the Germans will take if we decline is unknown, but we have been given an opportunity to resolve this conflict with some territorial gains."
 germany.80.a:0 "This is the best offer we'll get."
 germany.80.b:0 "We will not give what is rightfully ours for what they have stolen!"
 germany.81.t:0 "Danzig Ceded for Slovakia"
 germany.81.d:0 "Poland has agreed to the exchange wherein Danzig will be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], while Slovakia will now be under Polish control. Through this agreement, we have reclaimed Danzig while maintaining cordial, or at least not openly hostile, relations with our eastern neighbor."
 germany.81.a:0 "Germany is one again."
 germany.82.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses to give up Danzig"
 germany.82.d:0 "Our generous offer of Slovakian territories to [From.GetNameDef] in exchange for Danzig has been rejected, leaving Danzig in Polish hands. Clearly, [From.GetLeader] does not share our understanding of Danzig as rightfully German territory. \n[Root.GetLeader] is furious, and the diplomatic options for reclaiming Danzig appear to have been exhausted."
 germany.82.a:0 "It may be time to consider other options."
 germany.83.t:0 "Anti-Soviet Pact"
 germany.83.d:0 "With the Anti-Comintern Pact, Germany has secured fertile ground for diplomatic means of containing the Soviet menace. However, the pact does not constitute a military alliance, nor does it contain well-defined obligations for the signatories. [From.GetLeader] now seeks to extend the pact to an Anti-Soviet coalition, a binding agreement to join together in war if any signatory enters into a state of war with the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile substantially more dangerous, and likely to bring an end to any diplomacy we still maintain with the Soviets, this is also our chance to ensure that we have strong allies on our side in the case of war."
 germany.83.a:0 "We will stand by Germany and its allies against the Soviets."
 germany.83.b:0 "Anyone could start another world war with such a pact."
 germany.84.t:0 "Call Pact Members to War"
 germany.84.d:0 "Just as we suspected when we signed the Anti-Soviet Pact, we now find ourselves in a state of war with the Soviet Union. It is time for our co-signatories to honor their promise and join us."
 germany.84.a:0 "Our foresight pays off."
 germany.85.t:0 "[From.GetName] Calls Pact Members to War"
 germany.85.d:1 "The Anti-Soviet Pact stipulates that all signatories must join in any defensive conflict with the Soviet Union. [From.GetName] has now been attacked by the Soviets and has sent out a request for all pact members to come to their aid immediately. It is time to show the [Root.GetAdjective] dedication to protecting the world from the threat of the Soviet Union once and for all."

The book is a translation of excerpts from an obscure Greek historian who lived shortly after of Confucius, and short essays about the possibility of a 'great power conflict' between the established hegemon and a new 'rising' power. Like many others in the political establishment, Gao considers the Byzantine Commune to be the greatest threat to Chinese dominance - not just on ideological lines, but due to its staggering increase in industrial outputs and population growth. While some specialists in Near Western history question the validity of Gao's interpretations, there are not a few people who would disagree with his assessment of Byzantium being the greatest immediate threat instead of Japan.

Dozens are dead, and our occupation forces are desperately short of supply.

While they believe in the values of personal liberty and free markets, they also emphasize the value of international institutions, treaties, and legal codes to guarantee the free movement of capital and ideas across borders, and eventually limiting the power of the state to interfere in capital movement. This represents a new outgrowth in pangalist thought, away from the laissez-faire of the failed Goethe administration.

She was chosen for this position largely due to her political connections, and despite the fact that she had no experience in tropical warfare and spoke none of the major languages in the region. In the course of three weeks, she visited multiple major cities, such as Bangkok, Saigon, and Hue, and toured some outposts and field positions. Two months later, she would produce a report titled 'Report on the Zhongnan Insurgency'. In it, she fired broadsides against the 'dysfunctional' civilian government, the 'hollowing out' of state capacity, an almost total lack of control of the countryside, Chinese distrust of local officials, and the 'decay' of the military police forces, which deceived the upper echelons through a 'flood of meaningless statistics'. She believed that a purely military solution to the insurgency was impossible, and that some form of political accommodation with minority groups and poorer workers would be necessary to stave off an uprising by 1940 at the earliest. In particular, she noted the Bamar, Shan, Viet, and Lao majority areas, as well as the Thais of the Kra Isthmus, were at greatest risk of rebelling."

Some factory owners have already started renegotiating some of the rights that were granted at the Matignon Agreements, with little to no resistance from the workers. We have an opportunity to officially revoke the newly gained worker rights countrywide, but risk them rallying behind [Root.GetCommunistParty] once again, in hopes that they will back another strike.

Their children go hungry and even though [Root.GetCommunistParty] are urging them to continue the strike, they do not possess the resources to continue.

 france.24.t:0 "The Communist Threat"
 france.24.d:0 "The threat that a united Germany and Soviet pose is too great to be ignored. After the two countries agreement for the partition of Poland we have a difficult choice to make. If we let [Root.GetCommunistParty] operate as they have so far we open ourselves to internal struggle as the Soviet grow in power. By proscribing any communist activities or affiliation with [Root.GetCommunistParty] we send a powerful signal to all citizens that we will not tolerate anyone who pose a threat to peace. \nTraditionally we have been able to include [Root.GetCommunistParty] in political discussions, but as they refuse to renounce their allegiance to Moscow it may be time to take drastic measures."

 hun.1.d:0 "Following weeks of panic and recriminations, the Gyóntatószék, Hungary's secret court, has released its report on the abduction of Caluna and Henter Sheppard. The ransom note, a bricolage thought to be the work of a madman, was actually made by a founding member of the Confabulists, a turn of the century art movement notable for ties to early Valerianism. The real tender vittles of the report are the pages concerning Confabulism and its ties to Hungarian political disputes, providing insight not only into turn of the century academic and artistic strife, but the workings of the secret police itself."

Coming from the oil industry, Landon wants to see greater economic freedom, while Roosevelt and the Democratic Party want to expand Social Security and ensure economic stability.

However, in light of the precarious state of the world and international developments in the last few years, President Roosevelt has decided to break with tradition and run for a third term. Republican Wendell Willkie, characterized as a dark horse candidate with a background as an industrialist with limited political experience, has been critical both of Roosevelt's economic interventionism and his justifications for running for a third term.\n\nAlthough the candidates have much in common in their foreign policies and Willkie wants to retain some form of the New Deal, many still consider this election a determining point for the future of American democracy."

 usa.8.t:0 "Landon vs Roosevelt"

Roosevelt, who has continued to campaign in favor of completing the programs he originally planned for his second term, is now running for president again. While he remains a popular candidate, Landon has continued to criticize his efforts to concentrate power in the hands of the president, and has accordingly avoided similar policies himself.\n\nThreats abroad, both to our own nation and others, remain a reality and neither candidate is in favor of the United States turning a blind eye to them. The question is who will lead the arsenal of democracy through these dire times."

Dewey to represent them.\n\nRoosevelt continues to have popular support, but many suspect he may not live to see the end of his term.

He is now challenging Roosevelt, supporting the conservative coalition.\n\nRoosevelt continues to be popular, but MacArthur's charisma and sense of duty has made a strong impression on voters. Does the military really know best?"

 usa.12.t:0 "Campaign of Douglas MacArthur"
 usa.12.d:0 "To challenge Roosevelt's record-length presidency, the Republicans have looked to respected military commanders, hoping to find a potential candidate to take America through this war. General Douglas MacArthur has been a popular nominee among the conservatives, but he is also an indispensable asset in the ongoing conflict and has been reluctant to spend his time campaigning for the presidency.\n\nHe nevertheless remains one of the more promising conservative candidates and can perhaps be convinced to campaign to avoid getting a moderate Republican president. Is it worth the sacrifice?"

However, the fact remains that the majority of the people seem to have reservations about their rule, and the opposition, although silenced for now, has made its point."

Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary.

If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."

The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."

 political.4.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 political.4.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."

 political.6.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war.

They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense.

 political.9.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."

 political.10.d:1 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."

 political.10.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 political.11.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 political.11.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."

That's as true in [Root.GetName] as anywhere else, and local businessmen with Pangalist sympathies are tapping into this desire to sow discontent with our leaders. It's only a low rumble at the moment, but it doesn't take much for a rumble to turn into a massive earthquake."

Some feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] have lost the ability to govern efficiently, others have been rather blatantly bribed. Whether they believe, or have been bought, they feel Pangalism will lead [Root.GetName] into the future.\n\nAs this faction consists of politicians, high-ranking military officers and influential businessmen, if they are not stopped they might quickly gather enough influence to launch a coup."

The [Root.GetRulingParty] government losing power? A normal emergency election after some unexpected abdications. Ignore the gunshots, or the fact [Root.GetLeader] is missing, possibly dead. Go shopping, take a trip, play with a puppy. Everything is fine in [Root.GetName], and there will never be a reason to be unhappy again.\n\nThe people aren't stupid, everyone knows exactly what happened, and that a [Root.GetAdjective] government is in charge now. They're also smart enough to shut up about it. Just like in China, the Pangalists have taken over quietly, and they have no intention of relinquishing control."

 political.103.t:0 "Pangalist Uprising!"
 political.103.d:1 "It was supposed to be a quiet takeover, like the Business Plot, but there wasn't enough support. Generals backed out, the public wasn't moved, certain moneyed interests got a bad feeling and washed their hands of the whole thing.

It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."

Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."

 political.14.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it.

 political.15.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 political.15.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 political.15.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 political.16.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 political.16.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

 political.18.d:1 "The rapidly growing [Root.GetAdjective] fascist movement has never claimed that they need majority support before they seize power, counting on uniting the nation under their leadership once their rule is established. However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."

The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."

People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly.

Stalin has made himself an icon, but at the cost of making many real enemies and innumerable imaginary ones.\n\nHaving seen the worst of internal power struggles, the General Secretary is prone to act on the slightest suspicion.

Mikhail Tukhachevsky is among the most prominent of the suspects, and one Stalin is keen to rid the army of. Meanwhile, the navy's frequent contact with foreigners has led to many of them being arrested as well.\n\nAlthough there are documents from our enemies proving their guilt, there is no telling if they fabricated them, or if they were given false information by those who wanted this purge in motion to begin with."

What is known is that what he feared eventually came to pass. Today, Leon Trotsky reemerged as having returned from his exile, and with the support of several influential party members and NKVD officers, launched a coup overthrowing Stalin's rule.\n\nThe former General Secretary was attacked in his home with an ice axe, and was swiftly executed along with several of his supporters. Tearing down the cult of personality he built up will take time, but the people know now at least that he was not immortal.\n\n One of the few survivors who managed to escape was Ivan Konev. The fierce supporter of Stalin has managed to gather some support and declared war on the Trotsky government, in an attempt to take back power and 'fulfill the vision of Comrade Stalin'."

It is speculated that the reason for this move was to free Valeria's administration in dealing with the so-called Western Roman Empire's assumed future conflict with the Red Rose Pact.

Many factories have been placed under British control as Britain seeks to crack down on any organization that backs the rebels. Now the Irish government operates independently only in the most mundane day-to-day tasks, while Britain has taken control of Ireland's foreign policy.

Many members of the top leadership, including cabinet ministers, generals, and some members of the royal family, have been arrested. This was apparently confirmed in a secret meeting of the Marathan Communist Party leadership last month. The newspapers are publishing long transcripts of the trials, which have uniformly led to admissions of guilt. There are rumors of footage about the party congress or the trials themselves, but we have not obtained any copies, nor is anyone willing to confirm its existence.

An interim government will be established until the first round of national elections in 1938. The British will still have military garrison rights across the vast territory, and will have a low tariff regime for Congolese exports. Although this cannot be said to be true independence, this is a major step along that road, and one that seems to have mollified even the most vehement critics of the British regime.

In her place, the so-called 'Communist Party of Byzantium' has instated a ruling council, and a 'Military Tribune', the aged Field Marshal Theodora Papadopoulou, who is almost certainly a figurehead leader. Travel in and out of the country is restricted, newspapers and magazines have been shuttered, and the opposition parties that were previously tolerated have now been harrassed by armed guards.

This was epitomized in the British Congo Colony, which totaled over 3.5 million square kilometers and had a population in the tens of millions. The socialist factions were split over what to do with all of this territory. At first, the prevailing policy was that the land had to be kept under British rule, to establish political 'tutelage', foster economic development, and safeguard valuable resources from foreign expansion. However, with pressure mounting from fellow socialist nations, more recent administrations felt that the territory had to be restored to some degree of self-governance, possibly along the Kenyan and Maputo models. After years of negotiations, the guidework for independence was laid out in the Humphrey-Dacko Treaty. The first step of the plan would establish all of the British held territories in Africa into a federal unicameral republic. The new constitution would allow the raising of an army, allow for local elections immediately and national elections in two years, independence in many economic matters, and institute land reform policies. If all goes well, we can expect the commonwealth to achieve full independence by 1945."

Hart, a former member of the Foreign Service and a professor at Trinity College, Cambridge, has previously written an eight-volume history of the Byzantine Commune and currently writes articles for the Times of London on international affairs. In this volume, he largely disregards the role of ideology in determining foreign policy, and asserts that pure power politics is the main driver of foreign policy actions. He views the world as divided into those more powerful states that do not desire war, in that they have more to lose, and those 'second tier' powers that are more aggressive out of economic constraints. Likewise, France is still a relatively disadvantaged power because of its lack of foreign colonies and loss of territory to the North German federation over the course of the nineteenth century. Hart, for his part, advocates closer ties to Byzantium out of necessity.

 byz.1.t:0 "The 'Prague Telegram' Published"
 byz.1.d:0 "Today, an article was published in the journal Exoterikon titled 'The Causes of Fascist Behavior', and authored by 'A Comrade in Prague'. The article notes aggressive behavior on the part of the 'Western Roman Empire' is likely to accelerate after the relative lack of action taken against the Polish invasion of Bohemia. The article then attempts to summarize a general 'fascist foreign policy', including a belief in perpetual warfare, its possible roots in French or other revanchism, and a government structure which prohibits an objective look at reality. The article then goes on to recommend a policy of preventing further expansion by forming international alliances and providing military assistance to threatened states. The author of the article is not known, but is speculated to be an extremely high-ranking official within the Byzantine government or military. The article has been passed around offices in Byzantion and Athens with keen interest."

 byz.2.t:0 "Military Doctrine Debate"
 byz.2.d:0 "In recent years, a debate has been raging within the Byzantine Armed Forces over how to reform army doctrines from those used in a smaller counterinsurgency force into a large standing army. A military writer named Roland Kornai has written a memo on 'deep battle theory', which first involves breaking the first line of defenses through combined-arms assaults, and then a followup attack with armored reserves, with the goal of destroying the enemy logistics capacity. The theory has gained some high-profile supporters, and is being discussed at multiple levels of the high command."

A group of old barricade fighters, now in their 70s and 80s, made their way through the streets of Byzantion and laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the Memorial to the Ten Thousand. Tribune [BYZ.GetLeader] spoke about the world they had built, and swore to them that what they had done would endure."

Given the extreme circumstances we are in, we did not spend too much time and money on the hour-long ceremony, but the very last of the old fighters made their way through the capital in horse-drawn carts like those used to storm the capital all those years ago. Our comrades in the Red Rose Pact also sent visiting delegations to attend."

 byz.5.d:0 "To conclude the events of the Third Great War, a military parade has been ordered to march this afternoon in the streets of Byzantion. While such overt military gestures had become unpopular after the First Great War, the public required some form of celebration of the end of the war. Every army was represented in the parade route, and all of our allies and co-belligerents against the Gauls also sent detachments. The Army chief of staff rode a white horse, and announced to the crowd that the enemy was defeated, and that the empire has been destroyed forever. In one of the most dramatic moments of the parade, members of the First Treaty Infantry Division carried the standards and eagles of the defeated Imperium upside down through the city, and hurled them to the ground."

 byz.6.d:0 "In a time of seven days, seventeen hours, and fifty minutes, a Byzantine pilot has been the first to go around the earth in an aeroplane solo. Carmela Mirra, a famous pilot with the Byzantine Air Force, was the first to accomplish the feat without an on-board navigator. Instead she flied in a modified Bakirtzis high-wing monoplane relying on a new 'auto-pilot' system and radio directional navigation. While the Chinese pilot Lin Xing is the first to go around the world in 1934 a Lantian L-15, he had the assistance of navigators and crew. This represents a substantial achievement in modern aviation."

He was shot several times and his mutilated body was found later that day. While the Gallic regime had engaged in various 'border incidents' involving Byzantine citizens throughout the summer of 1939, the brutality of this killing shocked and angered the Byzantine public. The outcry was so great that the army chief of staff, Theodora Papadopoulou, was dispatched to northern Italy to deliver the funeral oration. Her speech, lasting for a few minutes and comprised of less than 350 words, stirred up the Byzantine public further against the existential threat of Fascism."

Since 1930, the incumbent, Iouliana Erdemir, has promised much about domestic infrastructure investment and keeping the Commune safe from international chaos. \n\nWhile her reforms have been popular across many segments of Byzantine society, the ongoing armaments buildup has been met with criticism from her foremost opponent, the Labour candidate Giancarlo Lucenteforte. A machinist and veteran of the First World War, Lucenteforte is concerned about the consequences of an aggressive foreign policy and believes the Commune's 'reckless' military expenditure is unsustainable. There is even a strong showing by the liberal ARTEMIS party this year, under the charismatic Anna Swiderska, a Polish emigre and former schoolteacher. The polls are yet inconclusive, and the outcomes range from a surprise liberal victory to an Athens-Irenicist landslide."

 byz.9.d:0 "Since the office of Tribune was first established, no one, not even the most beloved tribunes, has ruled for three consecutive terms. However, in light of the precarious state of the world and international developments in the last few years, Tribune Erdemir has decided to break with tradition and run for a third term. The Labour candidate, Georgios Rotas, is an MP representing Kalamata. He is an established political operative and has the support of the dockworkers, steel unions, as well as the old liberal parties. \n\nAlthough the candidates have much in common in their foreign policy and Rotas wants to retain much of Erdemir's policies, many still consider this election an unusual event given the violent international situation. The polls close tonight, and Byzantium holds its breath."

Iouliana Erdemir, Tribune from 1934-1939, has seen her chance for a political comeback and is challenging the incumbent, [BYZ.GetLeader]. If this succeeds, she will be the first Tribune in history to serve non-consecutive terms. \n\nHer supporters allege that the Commune has taken a marked turn for the worse, and that stronger leadership is needed to weather the ongoing political crises."

However, there are many in the Republic who would rather stay out of this conflict between fascists and capitalists. Still others say that even a capitalist is better than a fascist, and that staying neutral only delays the inevitable. Regardless, this requires a vote, should we come to their aid or not?"

In a rushed press conference held in the Foreign Affairs Secretariat, representatives of the new government have cited vast conspiracies against the Byzantine people held by 'revisionists', 'reformers', and 'crypto-liberals', and a need to 'cure' the 'illnesses' that have plagued the Commune. Though much of the structure and function of the new party is unclear, the new 'Tribune' is none other than the Field Marshal Papadopoulou - over seventy years old and apparently chosen as a figurehead."

The Tribune herself is declaring that a 'small group' of disgrunted officers was caught in the middle of a coup attempt, and is calling on all Byzantine citizens to rise up and assist. Loyalist troops are massing outside government buildings, and the railway unions have announced a temporary general strike, applying to all trains in and out of Byzantion."

Protests have broken out calling for the military and radical left to step aside and for democratic elections to resume. However, they have been met with severe force. A main organizer of the protests, a Dr. Sartzetakis, was beaten to death by thugs in Athens as he was walking home. A lawyer from the University of Ankara, Ms. Gündüz, then uncovered evidence that these individuals were connected to the government and the secret police, but she was arrested, and all of the witnesses died mysteriously in accidents, illnesses, or 'falls'. The subsequent trials were a mere formality, with no substantive punishment administered and administrative reprimands to the officers in turn. The CPB has cracked down further on civil society, banning avant-garde art, 'revisionist' sociology and political theory, Extebarrian economics, photographs of Tribune Erdemir, Ms. Gunduz, or Dr. Sartzetakis, and the letter 'Z'."

 ig.101.d:0 "There has been a good deal of hype among fascist intellectuals in recent weeks, as Aurélie Fabron has published a new work of political theory, ‘On Geopolitics’. \nFabron was an early supporter of the rise of Valeria Imperatrix in the 1930s out of contempt for the 'sclerotic’ French Republic, and a member of Valeria’s salon before she came to power. Aside from legal opinions justifying the need for a strong executive, she has written in the past about the power of a single dictator to make rapid decisions without a need for deliberation; a need for a strong messianic leader, a ‘dominus’, to combat the evils of human nature; and the redefinition of politics as ideological combat. \nIn this collection of essays, she moves out of her usual domains of political and legal theory and instead to 'speculations' over the future of Gallic foreign policy. First, she believes that the North German Federation will need to be ‘subsumed’ either by conquest or the use of propaganda to destabilize the government. Second, the Caesarist regime in Third Rome is ‘unstable’ but a valuable ally. Finally, the most imminent threat to the new Imperium is the Byzantine Commune. This is due to its rapid remilitarization, the pro-military staff at its higher ranks, and ‘conquest’ of the New World through the imposition of the new Ayitian government. Already, several members of the cabinet and the military elite have been spotted with copies of the book."

He gained notority in 1934 with a series of high profile kidnapping cases. While the new Ayitian government has been able to dismantle much of his organization and free dozens of captives in the past few months, the man himself has proven hard to spot. With his death, the Ayitian people can sleep a little easier tonight."

 ayiti.102.d:0 "Over the past few months, a series of severe dust storms has damaged the farmland of the extreme west of the mainland, caused by high winds and dry conditions. Unanchored soil has been turned to dust and blown away in storms, blanketing the country in thick clouds. Much of the topsoil and infrastructure of the region has been heavily damaged. While we have managed to avoid the worst due to handouts from our strategic grain reserve, the irrigation and road systems of that part of the country have been severely damaged, and will need federal government intervention to recover."

 silla.1.d:0 "A few days ago, we have recieved word that a massive cargo train from the West has been ambushed and destroyed by an unknown party near Uyar, east of the Yenisei river. The wreckage, as well as spent ammunition and several bodies, was found by another train heading along the same line. We believe the crew and the passengers are all lost, and much of the cargo - rare gems and valuable ores - is missing. The story has spread like wildfire through the domestic and international press, and perhaps highlights the dangers we face in controlling such a vast territory now that China is more hostile towards us. We are also receiving intense domestic criticism."

A former member of the politburo, clearly fatigued, listed the names of some eighty-six co-conspirators, who were identified at the party meeting and then forced outside. The remaining party members spontaneously affirmed their loyalty to Rishma Sharqi and their fanaticism in rooting out any anti-party elements. Those accused of conspiracy were led out of the room.

The Vagabond and the Princess, a musical comedy, was released to wide acclaim today. The plot concerns a poor peasant and a successful singer who switch places.

When our troops reached the barricaded factories, they found the strikers ready for them. Attempts to clear roads were met with furious attacks by the workers throwing stones and bottles at the soldiers. \n\nIn several instances, the troops opened fire to defend themselves, killing a number of strikers and wounding scores more. this only enraged the mob even further, with screams of "Murderers!" filling the air from bystanders. The mood in the capital turned dramatically in favor of the strikers.

And the victories of the assembly line should be celebrated just as much as the ones won by the front line."\n\nAll available propaganda resources have been rerouted to show the work of the armaments workers in the best possible light. [Root.GetLeader] has personally approved a new award to be given out for workers who have exceeded their quota by more than 100%, and the first recipients have been sent on tours around the country to instruct other workers in their methods.\n\nIt appears that this has made a lot of the strikers reconsider their stance.

Leaving a small detachment to guard the prisoners, the troops sweept the town, arresting everyone on the list of known factory workers. By noon, the military had taken full control of the cities and instituted a curfew. No further resistence is expected.
