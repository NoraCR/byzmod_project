Copy or Clone this directory into your My Documents/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod folder (or equivalent).

Copy and paste "byzfire.mod" into your Hearts of Iron IV mod folder.

The mod should have two .mod files, one inside the mod and the other in the /mod folder (that's the old one). The one in the mod is exactly the same except that you remove the path line.

In the copy of the folder that you've created outside of the byzfire director, change 'supported_version' to 'version'. 

Rename this directory from "byzmod_project" to "byzfire".

If necessary, make a test pull then test commit and push (create an empty text file called test.txt or something) to ensure GitHub is working.

Test to ensure you can load the mod in Hearts of Iron IV.
